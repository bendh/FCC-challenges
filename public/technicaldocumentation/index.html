          <p>You should already have some programming knowledge</p>
          <p>You should know the concepts of variables, loops and working with conditions<p>

        <section class="main-section" id="Java_and_Kotlin"><header>Java and Kotlin</header>
          <p>Java was the first language to run on the JVM. JVM stands for Java virtual machine. The JVM provides a unified runtime to run Java code on any platform. The credo of Java is "write once, run anywhere".</p>
          <p>Kotlin is a new language for the JVM designed by Jetbrains. It has taken the best features of Java, C# and Javascript. It's a fun and productive language to use.</p>
          <p>Kotlin is the prefered language for writing Android apps.</p>
          <p>Kotlin is expanding beyon the JVM and targeting also native platforms.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Hello_world"><header>Hello world</header>
          <p>In this section we will write a Hello world console program in Java and Kotlin.</p>
          <p>Every Java runnable program needs to have a class with a public static main method. To print to the console you need the System.out.print function.</p>
          <code>public class HelloWorld {
            
              public static void main(String[] args) {
              System.out.println("Hello world");
            }
          
            }
          </code>
          <p>For Kotlin you will need the same but the code is less verbose as you can see</p>
          <code>fun main(args: Array<String>) {
          println("Hello, world!")
      }</code>
            There are some diference to note:
            <ul>
              <li>The kotlin code don't need to be in a class</li>
              <li>Because the main function is written in a package file, you can omit the method modifiers public and static</li>
              <li>No comma's are needed in kotlin</li>
              <li>println is called directly</li>
              <li>type definition is placed after the variable name</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Objects_and_primitives"><header>Objects and primitives</header>
          <p>In this section we will discuss the difference between Object's and primitive types</p>
          <p>To declare a variable in Java you specify the access modifier, type and name. To declare a private String called name you would write:
            <code>private String name;</code>
            <p>This name variable is declared but not yet initialised. If you try to access this variable you will be a <strong>dreaded</strong> Nullpointer exception</p>
          <code>private String name;
                int lenght = name.lenght(); // Will throw NullPointerException ;<(
          </code>
            <p>Primitives like boolean, int, long and double are always initialised</p>
            <code>int age; //Initialised with the value 0;
            </code>
